# Python-Challenge

This challenge contains two Python scripts analysing different datasets. 

The firt script (PyBank) analyses the financial records of a company by looking at a data set containing "Date" and "Profit/Losses" data. The PyBank script analyses the records and calculates the following values:

-The total number of months included in the dataset
-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest increase in profits was observed in August 2016 and the greatest decrease in profts was seen in February 2014. The results can be found by running the PyBank script and also as a text file in the PyBank folder.

The second part of the challenge (PyPoll) looked at a set of poll data for a rural town looking to modernise their vote-counting process. The Python script analyses the votes and calculates the following values:

-The total number of votes cast
-A complete list of candidates who received votes
-The percentage of votes each candidate won
-The total number of votes each candidate won
-The winner of the election based on popular vote

The winner of the election was Diana DeGette with 73.81% of the votes out of a total of 369711 votes cast. The complete results from the analysis can be found by running the script and also as a text file in the PyPoll folder.
